# NEMESIS - Molecular Modelling Environment
Nemesis is an advanced molecular structure builder. It is able to build a
molecule from predefined 3D fragments. Molecules can be visualized in
monoscopic and stereoscopic representations. The geometry of the built
molecule can be easily measured and manipulated.

## Documentation
The documentation is available [here](https://nemesis.ncbr.muni.cz).

## Building Package
The building and installation procedure can be found in the
[nemesis-build](https://github.com/kulhanek/nemesis-build) repository.
